Started coding exercise using angular/quickstart from
https://github.com/angular/quickstart


#tl;dr
`git clone https://github.com/pierrepln/wb-coding-exercise && cd wb-coding-exercise && npm i && npm start`



#Install Process (MacOS X)

Install node from https://nodejs.org/en/

Fire up a terminal and run
`git clone https://github.com/pierrepln/wb-coding-exercise`
then
`cd wb-coding-exercise`
then
`npm i`
then
`npm start`

It should open a browser for you.
nb: I'm using browsersync. It means you can access your local ip from any device on your local network and you will be able to test the app responsiveness


#My steps
First I wanted to get started quickly and get the simplest prototype. I followed the following steps.

1.Cloned a quickstart boilerplate

2.Created shallow modules and service

3.Linked modules and service to the app

4.Created FourSquare developer account and got my API id and
secret

5.Explored API documentation and selected 'explore' endpoint to answer my app need

6.Implemented API call draft in my service (with mock-up data for search tag)

7.Debugged thanks to console(ie. network tab) until successful request

8.Writing 'my steps' #

9.Writing 'TODO' #

10.Parse response or result component, select relevant informations and display it

11.Remove mock-up search and add search component input

12.Style app and its components


#TODO

Check and insure production readyness

???find picture for each venue???


#Bonus

Docker container (IIRC nginx as a nice docker-image that is
easy to get started with)

Performance on production: use compiler (ie. minify +  tree shaker + gzip)
