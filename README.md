Started coding exercise using angular/quickstart from
https://github.com/angular/quickstart

#TL;DR
`git clone https://github.com/pierrepln/wb-coding-exercise`

`npm i`

`npm start`

First I wanted to get started quickly and get the simplest prototype. I followed the following steps.

#My steps
Cloned a quickstart boilerplate
Created shallow modules and service
Linked modules and service to the app
Created FourSquare developer account and got my API id and secret
Explored API documentation and selected 'explore' endpoint to answer my app need
Implemented API call draft in my service (with mock-up data for search tag)
Debugged thanks to console(ie. network tab) until successful request
Writing 'my steps' #
Writing 'TODO' #

#TODO
Parse response or result component, select relevant informations and display it
Remove mock-up search and add search component input
...maybe split in extra steps later.

Style app and its components
Check and insure production readyness
#Bonus
Docker container (IIRC nginx as a nice docker-image that is easy to get started with)
Performance on production: use compiler (ie. minify +  tree shaker + gzip)
