Started coding exercise using angular/quickstart from
https://github.com/angular/quickstart

#TL;DR
`git clone https://github.com/pierrepln/wb-coding-exercise`

`npm i`

`npm start`

First I wanted to get started quickly and get the simplest prototype. I followed the following steps.

#My steps
Cloned a quickstart boilerplate

Created shallow modules and service

Linked modules and service to the app

Created FourSquare developer account and got my API id and
secret

Explored API documentation and selected 'explore' endpoint to answer my app need

Implemented API call draft in my service (with mock-up data for search tag)

Debugged thanks to console(ie. network tab) until successful request

Writing 'my steps' #

Writing 'TODO' #

Parse response or result component, select relevant informations and display it

#TODO

Remove mock-up search and add search component input
...maybe split in extra steps later.

Style app and its components

Check and insure production readyness

???find picture for each venue???

#Bonus
Docker container (IIRC nginx as a nice docker-image that is
easy to get started with)

Performance on production: use compiler (ie. minify +  tree shaker + gzip)
